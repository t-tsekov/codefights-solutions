<div class="markdown"><p>It is believed by some tribes of South Codelenica that only two events determine the person's destiny: the first time he picked a flower, and the first time he planted one. They also believe in the power of <a href="keyword://prime-number">prime numbers</a> and in the power of sums (and a bunch of other most probably unrelated stuff), so you are wondering if it has something to do with their belief in the destiny-determining events.</p>
<p>You know that you first picked a flower in year <code>a</code> of the Codelenican calendar, and planted it in year <code>b</code>. Now you're curious about the sum of all the <em>prime</em> numbers in the range <code>[a, b]</code>, to see if this number could possibly affect your life.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>For <code>a = 10</code> and <code>b = 20</code>, the output should be<br>
<code>primesSum(a, b) = 60</code>.</p>
<p>There are <code>4</code> <em>prime</em> numbers in the range <code>[10, 20]</code>: <code>11</code>, <code>13</code>, <code>17</code> and <code>19</code>. Their sum is equal to <code>11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 60</code>. It's a round number, maybe it does mean something?..</p>
