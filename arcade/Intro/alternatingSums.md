<div class="markdown"><p>Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into <em>team 1</em>, the second goes into <em>team 2</em>, the third goes into <em>team 1</em> again, the fourth into <em>team 2</em>, and so on.</p>
<p>You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of <em>team 1</em>, and the second element is the total weight of <em>team 2</em> after the division is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>For <code>a = [50, 60, 60, 45, 70]</code>, the output should be<br>
<code>alternatingSums(a) = [180, 105]</code>.</p>
