Given integers p and n, find the smallest non-negative n-digit integer (represented as a string) whose digits add up to p. If there is no such number, return "-1" instead.

Example
``````
For p = 15 and n = 3, the output should be
reversedSumOfDigits(p, n) = "159";

For p = 30 and n = 2, the output should be
reversedSumOfDigits(p, n) = "-1";

For p = 2 and n = 5, the output should be
reversedSumOfDigits(p, n) = "10001".
